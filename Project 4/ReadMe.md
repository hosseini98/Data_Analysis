# Customer value analysis
The goal of this post is to analyze a dataset and provide some useful information regarding customers demographics and buying behaviour. I choose to work on a dataset from IBM Watson Analytics (available here). I will give answers to assigned questions by visualization methods in Python. This dataset will show us the most profitable customers and how they interact. I will show you how you can increase profitable customer response, retention and growth. Let's start!
