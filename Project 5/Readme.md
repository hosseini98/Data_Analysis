Predicting Apple stock M
A time series describes how a variable is changing along time. Time is considered as a crucial factor in not only natural processes but also in the business world. Among them, here I will talk about the stock market. The motivation of mine for this post is first to get a better understanding of predictive models in time series analysis and second get myself familiar with the stock market. I will go into analyzing daily changes in Apple stock and will look at how we can predict it using more efficient Machine Learning methods for time series such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM). Although I take the stock market as a case study here, these methods are popular and quite applicable to most of the time series related modelling.
